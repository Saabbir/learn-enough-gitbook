# Mastering Shopify Theme Architecture

### **Introduction — So You Want to Understand Shopify Theme Architecture**

When you first open a Shopify theme folder, it feels a bit like walking into a library without knowing how books are organized. There are folders everywhere, strange `.json` and `.liquid` files, and unfamiliar naming conventions.

But like any good library, Shopify themes follow a **clear, elegant architecture**.

Once you understand the rules, everything clicks:

* Pages start making sense
* Sections feel like modular LEGO bricks
* Templates unlock customization
* Translations fall into place
* Config files stop being scary

This article will guide you through that journey — step by step — with a storytelling flow designed to help you remember everything effortlessly.

Let’s start at the beginning: the big picture.

***

## **1. Understanding Shopify Theme Architecture (The Big Picture)**

Shopify themes aren’t just HTML and CSS. They are **dynamic, server-rendered templates** built with Liquid and organized in a structure that makes Shopify’s entire system work.

#### **Why architecture matters**

* It enables merchants to customize pages visually
* It allows developers to build modular, scalable components
* It lets Shopify plug into any part of the storefront
* It enables Online Store 2.0 features like app blocks, JSON templates, and dynamic sections

#### **Why Online Store 2.0 changed everything**

Before OS 2.0:

* Only the homepage supported sections
* Page structures were rigid
* Merchants had limited control

After OS 2.0:

* Every page can have dynamic, reorderable sections
* Templates can be JSON
* App blocks are supported
* Themes became modular and extensible

This is why understanding theme architecture is **the most important skill** for any Shopify developer today.

Now that you know the “why,” let’s understand the structure itself.

***

## **2. Shopify Theme Directory Structure (The Map of Your Theme)**

Open any modern Shopify theme and you’ll see the same set of directories:

```
├── assets
├── config
├── layout
├── locales
├── sections
├── snippets
└── templates
    └── customers
```

This structure is **strictly defined** by Shopify.\
If you add unsupported folders, certain CLI commands (like `shopify theme dev`) won’t work.

Let’s explore these directories one by one, like rooms in a house.

***

### **layout/** — The Blueprint for Every Page

This folder contains the _master layout_ — usually:

* `theme.liquid` (required)
* `checkout.liquid` (for Shopify Plus)

Every page passes through `theme.liquid`, which defines:

* The `<head>` tag
* Scripts and styles
* Header
* Footer
* Global Liquid variables

It’s like the “frame” of the entire house.

***

### **templates/** — The Blueprints for Different Page Types

Templates determine **what type of page Shopify should render**.

Examples:

* `product.json`
* `collection.json`
* `cart.liquid`
* `page.contact.json`
* `customers/login.liquid`

Shopify’s supported template types include:

* product
* collection
* article
* blog
* page
* index
* search
* cart
* list-collections
* password
* customers/account
* metaobject
* …and more

Templates are the entry point:\
they load **sections**, which render your actual content.

But not all templates are the same.\
Enter: **Liquid vs JSON templates** (we’ll dive into these in the next section).

***

### **sections/** — The Modular, Customizable Building Blocks

Sections are the stars of Shopify’s modern architecture.

Each section is a self-contained component that can:

* Render HTML
* Load Liquid data
* Have settings
* Include blocks
* Be used across multiple pages

Sections allow merchants to customize layouts from the theme editor.

Examples of sections:

* Slideshow
* Featured collection
* Product information
* Header
* Footer
* Collage
* Rich text

Sections + JSON templates = merchant-powered drag-and-drop layouts.

***

### **snippets/** — Small, Reusable Pieces of Liquid

Snippets are partials.\
They help you avoid repeating markup.

Use snippets for things like:

* Product cards
* Price formatting
* Icons
* Badges
* Reusable loops

They cannot be edited via Theme Editor — they are strictly developer tools.

***

### **assets/** — The Theme’s Static Files

Everything visual or interactive lives here:

* SCSS/CSS
* JavaScript
* JSON (for structured data)
* Images
* Fonts
* SVGs

These files can be loaded using Shopify’s asset\_url and asset\_path filters.

***

### **config/** — How Themes Store Their Settings

This folder is often misunderstood by beginners.

It contains two important files:

#### **1. settings\_schema.json**

Defines:

* The structure of theme settings
* Sections for the “Theme Settings” editor
* Input types (color picker, text field, image picker, etc.)

#### **2. settings\_data.json**

Stores:

* The actual _values_ configured by the merchant

⚠️ **Important:**\
You should _not_ manually edit `settings_data.json`.\
It is generated by Shopify’s Theme Editor.

***

### **locales/** — Translation & Language Support

Files like:

* `en.default.json`
* `fr.json`
* `es.json`

These allow developers to:

* Translate text
* Localize labels
* Support multilingual stores

Shopify automatically loads the correct locale file based on store language.

***

## **3. Templates — Liquid vs JSON (A Major Shopify Concept)**

Shopify supports two types of templates:

***

### **Liquid Templates**

A Liquid template:

* Contains Liquid + HTML
* Has no section schema
* Cannot be rearranged by merchants
* Is more “developer-controlled”

Example:

```
product.liquid
```

Liquid templates are useful for:

* Very custom layouts
* Templates that must be Liquid (`gift_card`, `robots.txt`)
* When you want full developer control

***

### **JSON Templates**

JSON templates were introduced with OS 2.0 and changed everything.

A JSON template:

* Is a **data file**, not HTML
* Defines which sections a page includes
* Lets merchants add/reorder/remove sections
* Allows app blocks
* Has a strict schema

Example:

```
product.json
```

A JSON template contains:

* A “sections” object
* An “order” array

Example structure:

```json
{
  "sections": {
    "main": {
      "type": "main-product"
    },
    "related-products": {
      "type": "related-products"
    }
  },
  "order": ["main", "related-products"]
}
```

#### **JSON Template Limits**

* Max **1000 JSON templates**
* Max **25 sections per template**
* Max **50 blocks per section**

#### **Templates that MUST be Liquid**

* `gift_card`
* `robots.txt`

***

## **4. Sections & Blocks — The Heart of Modern Shopify Themes**

Sections are Shopify’s most powerful feature.

They allow developers to build:

* Modular components
* Merchant-editable content
* Flexible layouts

***

### **Anatomy of a Section**

A section has two important parts:

#### **1. Liquid markup**

The HTML/Liquid that renders the UI

```
<div class="product-title">{{ product.title }}</div>
```

#### **2. JSON schema**

Defines:

* Section settings
* Blocks
* Preset defaults
* Input types for Theme Editor

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Featured collection",
  "settings": [
    {
      "type": "collection",
      "id": "collection",
      "label": "Collection"
    }
  ],
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "product",
      "name": "Product",
      "settings": []
    }
  ],
  "max_blocks": 50
}
```

***

### **Static vs Dynamic Sections**

#### **Static sections**

* Hard-coded into Liquid (e.g., header, footer)
* Cannot be moved from Theme Editor

#### **Dynamic sections**

* Added via JSON templates
* Can be moved, removed, reordered

***

### **App Blocks**

Shopify apps can insert blocks _directly_ into themes.

This is only possible because of sections + JSON templates.

***

## **5. Config & Locales — The Theme’s Settings & Languages**

These two folders complete Shopify’s architectural system.

***

### **Theme Settings (config/settings\_schema.json)**

This file defines the structure of the theme settings UI.

Examples of what you can create:

* Color pickers
* Logo upload
* Typography controls
* Layout settings
* Global toggles

It makes the theme feel “customizable.”

***

### **Theme Data (config/settings\_data.json)**

This file stores the _actual values_ merchants pick:

* Selected logo
* Colors
* Font sizes
* Layout preferences

Shopify writes this file automatically.

***

### **Locales Folder (Translation System)**

Each theme can support multiple languages using JSON locale files.

Example:

```
locales/
  en.default.json
  fr.json
```

Inside each file:

```json
{
  "general": {
    "password_page": "Enter store using password"
  }
}
```

These are used with:

```
{{ 'general.password_page' | t }}
```

This system enables multilingual storefronts without needing separate themes.
