# Introduction to Shopify

## 🛒 **What Is Shopify?**

Shopify is an **all-in-one commerce platform** that enables individuals and businesses to create online stores, sell products, manage operations, and scale globally—without needing advanced technical knowledge.\
Its biggest strength is simplicity: everything from storefront design to payment processing, shipping, and analytics is built into one centralized platform.

**Key points:**

* Used by **millions of merchants worldwide**
* Supports online, in-store, and multi-channel selling
* Offers a high-performance checkout (Shop Pay)
* Known for reliability, scalability, and ease of use

## 📜 **History of Shopify**

Shopify’s story began with a problem rather than a business plan.

In 2004, founders **Tobias Lütke** and **Scott Lake** tried launching an online snowboard shop called **Snowdevil**. At the time, e-commerce tools were outdated, rigid, and frustrating to use.\
Tobi—a software engineer—decided to build the store platform himself using **Ruby on Rails**.

They quickly realized that the software powering Snowdevil had more potential than the snowboard shop itself.\
This idea evolved into Shopify.

## 🧑‍💻 **Founders & Founding Story**
