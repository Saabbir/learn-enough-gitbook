# How to Develop on Shopify: Dev Stores, Partners, and Tools

Shopify is a cloud-based SaaS commerce platform designed to handle everything involved in running an online, retail, or B2B store—from hosting and security to checkout and scaling. This allows businesses to focus on what they do best, while Shopify manages the infrastructure, performance, and updates.

For developers, freelancers, and agencies, Shopify provides a powerful, flexible environment to build custom solutions or optimize stores for clients. Whether you’re building themes, apps, scripts, or custom storefronts, Shopify offers the tools and ecosystem to support every stage of development.

This guide introduces the fundamentals of developing on Shopify, including dev stores, the Shopify Partner Program, and best practices for choosing the right store type.



## ⚙️ **Why Build on Shopify?**

Shopify supports millions of merchants—from small startups to enterprise brands—which means developers have massive opportunities.

Here’s why Shopify is considered one of the most developer-friendly commerce platforms:

#### **1. Fully Hosted Infrastructure**

Shopify manages hosting, security, PCI compliance, checkout updates, performance, and scaling. Developers don’t need to worry about server maintenance.

#### **2. Built-In Commerce Essentials**

Merchants get product management, checkout, orders, payments, and analytics out-of-the-box.\
This reduces the amount of custom code needed for basic store setups.

#### **3. Highly Extensible Platform**

For more complex businesses, Shopify supports:

* Custom themes
* Apps
* Headless storefronts (Hydrogen)
* APIs & webhooks
* Shopify Functions
* Custom checkout extensibility

#### **4. Huge Ecosystem of Apps & Themes**

Developers can:

* Create custom functionality
* Extend existing stores
* Build and sell apps or themes

#### **5. Cost-Effective Development**

As one Shopify agency owner put it:

> “Building on Shopify is more cost-efficient than building on other platforms because the technology enables you to do more with less.”



## 💡 **Before Writing a Single Line of Code: Start With Native Features**

One of the most important best practices for Shopify developers is:

> **Always go as far as possible with Shopify’s built-in functionality before custom development.**

Why?

* Native features are faster, more secure, and automatically maintained.
* Custom solutions introduce long-term tech debt.
* Publicly available apps often solve common problems efficiently.
* Shopify constantly releases new features that replace old custom hacks.

The best way to understand native Shopify capabilities is to **use a development store**.



## 🧪 **What Is a Shopify Development Store?**

A **development store** (often called a “dev store”) is a **free Shopify store** available to registered Shopify Partners. It is one of the most important tools for any developer.

You can use a dev store to:

* Test themes
* Build apps
* Explore Shopify features
* Create and configure stores for clients
* Experiment with new releases

Because dev stores are free and unlimited, they are essential for learning, experimenting, and client work.



## 🤝 **The Shopify Partner Program**

To create development stores, you must join the **Shopify Partner Program** — and the best part is: **it’s free**.

The program is ideal for:

* Developers
* Designers
* Freelancers
* Agencies
* App/theme builders

#### **Benefits include:**

* Unlimited development stores
* Recurring commissions for stores transferred to clients
* Access to developer previews and new features
* Ability to publish apps or themes
* Partner-only documentation and tools



## 🧰 **Two Types of Development Stores**

Shopify offers **two distinct types of dev stores**, each designed for different use cases.

Choosing the correct type is important — it prevents limitations later in your workflow.



### **1. Client Transfer Store**

Use this when you are building a real store for a client.

#### **Purpose**

* Set up and build fully functional client stores
* Transfer ownership when development is complete

#### **Key Features**

* Based on the latest Shopify release
* Can be upgraded into a real, paid store
* Includes most features from **Advanced** or **Plus** plans (depending on what you choose)

#### **Limitations**

* Cannot install **custom apps** or **draft apps**\
  (Use test and build stores for app development)
* Password page cannot be removed until ownership is transferred

#### **Use this when:**

✔ You are building a store for an actual business\
✔ You need to hand off ownership at the end\
✔ A merchant will be running the store long-term



### **2. Development Store**

Use this when you’re testing features or building apps/themes.

#### **Purpose**

* Experiment with Shopify functionality
* Test apps, draft apps, or private apps
* Use developer preview features
* Build themes or custom storefronts for internal work

#### **Key Features**

* Created from the **Developer Dashboard**
* Can include **pre-generated demo data**:\
  products, orders, customers, etc.
* Supports custom apps, draft apps, and private apps

#### **Limitations**

* **Cannot be transferred** to a client
* Some storefront features remain restricted
* Real transactions cannot be processed

#### **Use this when:**

✔ Building or testing apps\
✔ Testing custom themes\
✔ Experimenting with API functionality\
✔ Trying new Shopify features before public release



## 🔍 **How to Choose the Right Dev Store Type**

Before creating a store, ask yourself one question:

> **Am I building this store for a client or for myself?**

#### If the store is for a client →

**Use a Client Transfer Store**

#### If the store is for testing, experimenting, development, or learning →

**Use a Development Store**

Choosing the correct type early saves time and prevents migration issues.



## ⚠️ **Development Store Limitations**

Dev stores are powerful but come with certain restrictions:

#### **General limitations**

* Only free or partner-friendly apps can be installed
* Only test orders can be created (using Bogus Test or Payment Test Mode)
* Real payment gateways cannot be used
* Password page cannot be removed
* Many Shopify Plus features may be restricted (unless using Plus dev store)

#### **Client transfer store limitations**

* Cannot install custom/draft apps
* Cannot use pre-generated data

#### **Test and build store limitations**

* Store cannot be transferred
* Pre-generated data makes the store permanently **non-transferable**



## 🎯 **Conclusion**

Developing on Shopify is one of the most accessible and scalable paths for developers, thanks to its powerful APIs, robust ecosystem, and fully managed infrastructure. Whether you’re a freelancer building client stores or a developer creating apps, development stores and the Partner Program give you everything needed to experiment, build, and deliver quality work at no cost.

By understanding the differences between **Client Transfer Stores** and **Development Stores**, and by starting with Shopify’s built-in capabilities before moving to custom solutions, developers can build more efficiently, reduce long-term maintenance, and deliver better outcomes for merchants.

If you're beginning your Shopify development journey, creating your first dev store is always the best first step.
