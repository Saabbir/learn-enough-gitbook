# Node.js

Node.js, created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl, is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a web browser. Primarily used for server-side programming, Node.js allows JavaScript to be used for both client- and server-side applications, utilizing an event-driven architecture that efficiently handles numerous concurrent connections via a single thread. It incorporates the V8 JavaScript engine and is supported by the Node.js Foundation. Node.js is often used for real-time applications.
